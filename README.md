# MCP Server ms_Access 🚀

A powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration with Microsoft Access databases. This server enables you to create, manage, and query Access databases through MCP-compatible applications like Kiro IDE.

## Prerequisites

- **Windows Operating System** (required for Access integration)
- **Python 3.13+**
- **Microsoft Access Database Engine** It is recommended to use the 2016 version.(required - see installation guide below)
- **uv** package manager (recommended)

### ⚠️ Important: Bit Architecture Compatibility

**Python , Microsoft Access,Microsoft Access Database Engine must have the same bit architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).**
Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable

Choose:

AccessDatabaseEngine.exe → for 32-bit systems or 32-bit Office

AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe → for 64-bit Office

🧪 Summary:
Feature	                     2010 Engine	         2016 Engine
Compatibility	           Office 2010–2013	       Office 2010–2021
New Excel/Access support	 ❌ Limited	                ✅ Full
Future-proof	             ❌ No	                    ✅ Yes
Stability	                 ✅ Yes                   	✅ Yes
Bitness must match Office	 ✅ Yes	                    ✅ Yes

#### Check Your Python Architecture

Open your terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run:

```bash
python -c "import platform; print(platform.architecture())"
```

This will show either:
- `('64bit', 'WindowsPE')` - You have 64-bit Python
- `('32bit', 'WindowsPE')` - You have 32-bit Python

#### Check Your Office/Excel Architecture

1. Open **Excel**
2. Click **File** tab
3. Choose **Account**
4. Click **About Excel**

You'll see something like:
```
Microsoft® Excel® 2016 MSO (Version 2506 Build 16.0.18925.20076) 32-bit
```
or
```
Microsoft® Excel® 2019 MSO (Version 2506 Build 16.0.18925.20076) 64-bit
```

The last part shows whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Office.

### Installing Microsoft Access Database Engine

**You must install the Access Database Engine that matches your Python architecture:**

#### For 64-bit Python:
- Download: [Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable (64-bit)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920)
- File: `AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe`

#### For 32-bit Python:
- Download: [Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable (32-bit)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920)
- File: `AccessDatabaseEngine.exe`

#### Installation Notes:
We will run the server inside a virtual environment.

```


# **Prompt Samples**

(1)Using msaccess MCP server to connect 
C:\Users\it\AppData\Local\Programs\Kiro\treeview.accdb Make sure to save the changes and close the database  tool when  connecting
to it and  ensure use this tool when  encounter an error.
.
i creat form to display accounts as tree 
look at image attached 7.1.png
i need create report look like as 7.png image attached 
using mcp to do that ?

 (2)Create a Microsoft Access database named pos.accdb in this path F:\mcp_server_ms_access_control

 for a Point of Sale (POS) system with the following structure:

Database  Name pos.accdb

📦 Items Table:

ItemID: unique ID (AutoNumber)

ItemName: name of the item

ItemPrice: price per unit

ItemDescription: optional text

🔁 Transactions Table:

TransactionID: unique ID (AutoNumber)

ItemID: link to the Items table

TransactionType: either "Purchase" or "Sales"

Quantity: number of items

TransactionDate: date of transaction

💸 Expenses Table:

ExpenseID: unique ID (AutoNumber)

ExpenseType: type/category of expense

Amount: how much was spent

ExpenseDate: date of expense

---

Create and save four queries:

1. Sales Amount Between Two Dates

Calculate the total sales (item price × quantity) filtered by a start and end date.

2. Purchase Amount Between Two Dates

Calculate total purchases (item price × quantity) between two dates.

3. Sum of Items Sold Between Two Dates

Group by item name and calculate how many of each item was sold between two dates.

4 detail expense between two dates

---

Save the queries as:

qry_SalesAmount_BetweenDates

qry_PurchaseAmount_BetweenDates

qry_SumSoldItems_BetweenDates

qry_expense_details

fix Issue may Encountered & Fixed:
The only issue was with the Items table creation - the initial ItemDescription field size (500 characters) was too large for Access. I fixed this by reducing it to 255 characters, which is the standard maximum for Access text fields.

All queries use parameter prompts [Start Date] and [End Date] so when you run them in Access, you'll be prompted to enter the date range. The database is ready for use!

```
import win32com.client
adox = win32com.client.Dispatch("ADOX.Catalog")
conn_string = f"Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source={db_path};"
adox.Create(conn_string)  # This creates the .accdb file

ADOX and why it's more reliable than ODBC
ADOX (ActiveX Data Objects Extensions) is a Microsoft COM library specifically designed for database schema operations like creating databases and tables.

Why ADOX is better than ODBC for creating Access databases:

ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a general-purpose database interface that sometimes has registry access issues on Windows
ADOX uses Windows COM (Component Object Model) which has direct access to the Access database engine
ADOX bypasses the registry issues that cause the "Unable to open registry key" errors you were seeing
ADOX is Microsoft's recommended method for programmatically creating Access databases
Here's what happens in the code:


pyodbc 

Driver detection: The code uses pyodbc.drivers() to list available database drivers
Table creation and data operations: After ADOX creates the empty database file, pyodbc is used to:
Connect to the database
Create the  table
Insert sample data
Read data for verification


ADOX: Creates the empty .accdb file
pyodbc: Handles all the SQL operations (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT)
So the combination gives you the best of both worlds:

ADOX for reliable database file creation
pyodbc for standard SQL operations
This is why your script now works - it uses the most reliable method for each task instead of trying to do everything through ODBC alone.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Access Driver Not Found**
   ```
   Exception: Access ODBC driver not found
   ```
   **Solution:**
   - Install Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable
   - **Critical:** Ensure the database engine matches your Python architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
   - Check available drivers: `python -c "import pyodbc; print(pyodbc.drivers())"`

2. **Architecture Mismatch Error**
   ```
   [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] The specified DSN contains an architecture mismatch
   ```
   **Solution:**
   - Your Python and Access Database Engine have different architectures
   - Check Python architecture: `python -c "import platform; print(platform.architecture())"`
   - Check Office architecture: Excel → File → Account → About Excel
   - Install matching Access Database Engine version

3. **Office 2016/2019 Installation Conflicts**
   ```
   You cannot install the 64-bit version of Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 because you currently have 32-bit Office products installed
   ```
   **Solution:**
   - Use the `/quiet` parameter: `AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe /quiet`
   - Or uninstall existing Office, install database engine, then reinstall Office
   - Consider using the same architecture for both Python and Office

4. **Permission Errors**
   - Run installer as Administrator
   - Check file permissions in the target directory
   - Ensure the database file location is writable

5. **Python Path Issues**
   - Ensure your virtual environment is activated
   - Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip list`
   - Check if pywin32 is properly installed: `python -c "import win32com.client"`
